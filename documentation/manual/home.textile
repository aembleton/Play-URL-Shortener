h1. Play URL Shortener

Provides a simple tag for shortening URLs inside a view.  For example:

pre. #{shorten.url 'http://www.example.com'/}

will render to:

pre. http://is.gd/RGW31T

There is not currently any way of adding further parameters and only is.gd can be used.

h2. Installation

h3. Module installation

Download this whole project into a directory called urlShortener and copy that to the modules directory inside your play framework.  I'll try and get this added to the modules repository soon to make this step easier.

h3. Enable the module

After installing the module, add the following to your @application.conf@ to enable it:

bc. module.shortener=${play.path}/modules/urlShortener
